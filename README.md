Synopsis: this is work done on a challenge from DataQuest. The analysis is basis on a survey on Star Wars to answer the question: which Star Wars movie does the public like most?

The analysis shows that the 5th movie is the most liked of all, both among people who self-identify as Star Wars fans and people who do not. Among people who do not, it is also the movie that's been seen the most.

The data are from https://github.com/fivethirtyeight/data/tree/master/star-wars-survey (credit to the fivethirthyeight project).
